How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Since diff gives a list of same and different lines in both files. So looking at lines having differences can help in finding error. In this way i don't jave to look all the lines just only a bunch of ifferent lines.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Undoing any changes is easy. If there is mistakingly any error introduced then you can move to previous version and figure out the error using diff commands.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

It is more of intuitive approach and may vary from person to person and experiences they have.

Pros :-
 		Cluttering is avoided.
 		Helpful if the person/programmer involved is experienced.
 		Flexibility.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because in a larger project where changing a file may affect another it is necessary to commit all so that we must e able to see the results.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	Git log is used to view all the commits that have been made with unique commit id, author name, message  and date.
	Git log --stat also shows what additional info like no. of file changed and insertions and deletions
	git diff is used to compare two different commits.
